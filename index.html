            <p class="main-content">My name is Andrew Guzman, I'm a first-generation Mexican-American living in
                California. My favorite hobby is going for hikes. I especially enjoy hiking in nature as it's a nice way
                to get away from the city. I appreciate this pastime because I get to spend time in nature while
                exercising my body which is beneficial for my mental health. The mental and physical health benefits of
                this activity are what makes it my favorite activity.</p>

            <p class="main-content"> Hiking is a very easy hobby to get started with, but there are some pieces of
                advice you should follow
                to ensure it's a good experience for everybody involved. First, I would pick hikes that are geared
                towards beginners to make sure you
                don't over-exert yourself which can be dangerous without proper preparation. Second, make sure you
                invest in appropriate hiking gear. Hiking is a physical activity after all, so you want to be sure to
                wear appropriate clothing to make sure you are comfortable. Third, always make sure you tell someone you
                trust about where you will be to make sure you are safe. And finally, clean up after yourself and leave
                no trace behind! <br>
                An additional tip I have is to remember to pack enough water and snacks for the duration of your hike.
                This one is almost a non-negotiable as it can be extremely dangerous if you were to get lost somewhere
                without food and water. If you like using mobile apps, you can try out AllTrails which has thousands of
                guides and maps at your disposal. This one is especially helpful as it allows you to filter hikes based
                on difficulty, length, and time.</p>
